# what is loop and why we need loops in programming lang ?
# for loop is used to itearte over a seq/range
# def add():
#     print(100)


# for i in range(1,11):
#     add()


# a=[2,1,"vas",123456]
# for i in a:
#     print(i)
# # a[0]
# # a[1]
# # a[2]
# # a[3]
# data=[{id:1,name;"ytmato"},{},{},{},{},{}]

# for i in data:
#     print(i)


# 2. what is for loop vs while loop ?
# for loop is used when we know iteration count 
# while loop is used when we dont know iteration count but we know when to stop loop
# password=12345
# maxLimit=5
# while maxLimit>0:#5>=0 4>=0 3>=0 2>=0 1>=0 0>=0
#     pswd=int(input("enter password here :--   "))
#     if pswd == password:
#         print("password crct and mobile opned")
#         break
#     else:
#         maxLimit-=1
# if maxLimit==0:
#     print("you are done with 5 chnaces")

# what is d/f b/w the pass and continue and break 
# pass is used to juts pass the statement and does not return anything
# continue is used to skip the current iteartion based on condition
# break is used to breakthe entire loop based on certain condition

# what is function ?
# function is a block of code which is used to perfporm particualr task
# types of functions?
# 2 types
# built in  len(),input(),print(),max(),min() etc..
# user defined add(),multiply()

# based on up on args 
# with args and params
# with args and params with return
# without args and params and return 
# with varaible length args (1,2,4) (*arg) tuple
# with keyword length args (name="vamsi",age=27) (**args) {}


# scope ?
# a specific place where i can access specific functions r varibles is called as scope
# types of scopes 
# L - local function
# E - enclosed
# G - global
# B - built-in


# modules ? types of modules ?
# module is nothing but pre-written code in the form of functions r vraibles r objects etc..

# 3 types
# inbuilt re,math,datteime,random,os,fs
# user-defined 
# third-party packages mysql-p-c, numpy, pandas, matplotlib ,seaborn,scikitlearn,scipyetc..
